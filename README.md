High level authentication is important to provide higher security to manufacturers and consumers for different products. Previous security techniques such as AES encryption fails to provide higher level security because of complex structure of data in supply chain  such problems can be easily handles by blockchain technology. In the proposed method Hyperledger and decentralized solution provides high level security to the products for manufacturer as well as consumers. In supply chain more security is provided by proposed algorithm by barcode based blockchain technology, by providing secure and transparent transactions throughout supply chain. So, the consumer trust can be enhanced by tracking all secure transaction through product lifecycle. Hashcode generated and timestamp of each block is shown in results to get clear information about the proposed model. Proposed model even uses deep learning techniques to get improvement in the results. Hyperledger technique is used in proposed system for blockchain and for backend python is used and results are shown on local host.
